    <h1>Welcome to Plovdiv!</h1>
    <p>
        Plovdiv is Bulgariaâ€™s cultural heart, famed for its ancient heritage and dynamic arts scene. Built around seven hills, this historic city boasts Roman ruins, such as the beautifully preserved Ancient Theatre, still used today for performances. The Old Town enchants visitors with its cobbled streets, colorful 19th-century houses, and art galleries. Plovdiv is also known for the vibrant Kapana District, where trendy cafes, boutiques, and art installations give it a youthful energy. 
        Designated as a European Capital of Culture in 2019, Plovdiv seamlessly blends antiquity with contemporary creativity.
